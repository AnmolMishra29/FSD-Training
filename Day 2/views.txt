A view is a database object that has no values. Its contents are based on the base table. It contains rows and columns similar to the real table. In MySQL, the View is a virtual table created by a query by joining one or more tables. It is operated similarly to the base table but does not contain any data of its own.


We use view because it allows us to simplify complex queries

CREATE VIEW view_name AS    
SELECT column1, column2    
FROM table    
[WHERE conditions];
